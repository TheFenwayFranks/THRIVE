- **Steady (ðŸš¶):** 5 moderate exercises (squats, walking, arm circles)  
- **Beast Mode (ðŸ”¥):** 5 high-energy exercises (jumping jacks, burpees, mountain climbers)

### User Experience

- Clear difficulty selection screen
- One-click workout completion
- Visual progress tracking

- Celebration alerts when workouts are completed

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:
- `EmergencyBypass.tsx` - Single-screen THRIVE app with all basic functionality
- `App-Emergency.tsx` - Simplified app entry point (no navigation)
- `App.tsx` - Replaced with emergency version
- `App-Backup-Navigation.tsx` - Backup of original navigation-based app
- `ecosystem-emergency.config.js` - PM2 configuration for emergency mode

### Architecture:
- **No Navigation Dependencies:** Completely removes React Navigation
- **Single Component:** All functionality in one self-contained component
- **Static Data:** Workout database built into the component (no external dependencies)
- **Simple State:** Only uses basic React state (no complex persistence)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (After Emergency Resolved)

1. **Debug Navigation System:**
   - Restore `App-Backup-Navigation.tsx` as `App.tsx`
   - Identify root cause of white screen navigation failures
   - Test each tab component individually
   - Fix routing and component loading issues

2. **Gradual Feature Restoration:**
   - Re-enable AsyncStorage for data persistence
   - Restore morning flow system
   - Add back progress tracking
   - Integrate community features

3. **Enhanced Emergency Features:**
   - Add timer functionality to workouts
   - Include workout instructions/GIFs
   - Add achievement system
   - Implement basic data export
